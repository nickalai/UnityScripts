# Unity Scripts

This is a repository of varous scripts that I have written over the period of my experiences with Unity. These scripts were built written for specific projects, but are some that I feel like I use in multiple projects or have multiple uses in other projects.

## Setup

Each script has a description in the header comment on what it does and how to use it in Unity, so refer to there :) 
Each script also has in line comments describing what odd parts of the code do in a more general way.
